# gospl - SPL compiler written in Go

## Introduction
gospl is a compiler for SPL (Simple Programming Language) written in Go.
It is my second attempt at writing a compiler ([kompilator](https://github.com/Minnozz/kompilator) being the first).

## Credits
* Some of the design is heavily borrowed from the Go [scanner](https://golang.org/pkg/go/scanner/) and [parser](https://golang.org/pkg/go/parser/).
* The definition of SPL has been taken from the Compiler Construction course of Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
* Tests 0 to 23 were borrowed from [Jille/splparser](https://github.com/Jille/splparser).
